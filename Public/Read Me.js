/**
* Additional Information:
*
* This template allows you to add or remove eyebrows from 
* the users face using SnapML. 
*
* The ML model in this template outputs two textures: 
* one which has full eyebrows, and another which has no eyebrows. 
* You can mix between the two textures by sliding the 
* `Brows Intensity` slider on the AdaptToDeviceController_Brows object.  
*
* You can mask the result of the ML Model output 
* (e.g. to create an eyebrow shape) by modifying the Base Texture on the 
* `Face Mesh Brows Mask Unlit [Try swapping texture]` material. 
* This material is used on a Face Mesh to position your eyebrow mask 
* texture onto the face. 
*
* To make your own eyebrows mask, take a look at the example images 
* for reference, as well as the Face Mesh guide to learn more 
* about creating a texture for it:

* Happy creating!
